<!--The Introducition-->               
                In. Indian culture there are many festivals to celebrate and enjoy.
                <br>
               But, in ancinet times thes festivals were celebrated very scientifically, 
                <br>
                without harming the nature. We celebrate the same festivals in the same way...
                <br>
                <br>
                But we have forgotten the science behind it use din the ancient times and celebrate it blindly,
                <br>
                while polluting the nature...
                <br>
            </span>  
            <br> 
                This is one of our favorite festival but nowadays HOLI is not a festival
                <br> 
                it has become something more dangerous but we can prevent this by following ways.

                <img src="Point-1.jpg"><br>
        <li>1.Celebrate it in a dry way<br>
            India wastes as much water as the whole United Kingdom consumes in a year. 
            <br>We must reserve our water before a serious worst water crisis hits India. 
            <br>If you are playing wet Holi, there is often the use of pichkaris and water balloons will create unnecessary garbage, 
            <br>waste a lot of water and pollute the environment. Therefore, celebrate a dry Holi to avoid such unnecessary harm to the environment. 
            <br>So, this Holi is a responsible citizen and celebrate dry Holi.<br>
            
    
            <img src="Point-2.jpg"><br>
        <li>2.Don’t force someone to play Holy or throw colors at random people<br>
            Dont force someone to play holi with you if they are worried about thier<br>
            skin, hair or coronavirus do not force them to play as it is their choice.
            <br>For who knows that the color you are using is a very hazardrous colors,
            <br>and could be a cause of many skin dirsorders and complications...    
    
        <img src="Point-3.jpg"><br>
        <li>3.Avoid playing in mud and dirty places<br>
            Many people go without thinking the dankgers and start to play in the wet mud.
            <br>They sit and lie down in dirty places without realizing the risks of getting sick.
            <br>Celebrating Holi in the middle of coronavirus outbreak can be uncertain, 
            <br>so avoid playing in the mud or dirty places. This could also lead to some problems in the body,
            <br>as we would not notice when we accidently swallowed the mud which coudl either lead to,
            <br>stomach upsets or in thw worst case respitory problems. 
            
        <img src="Point-4.jpg"><br>   
        <li>4. Play Holi with natural colors<br>
            Playing Holi with natural colors is the best way to celebrate this colorful festival. 
            <br>Don’t ruin it by using harmful and irrelevant products like petrol, oil paints, mud, and other chemical-based products.
            <br>These products are not only hazardous to your health but also to the environment.
            <br>It also harms the skins and leaves undesired effect on skin and is hard to clean.
            <br>The natural colors are give the same joy and are eco-friendly, they decompose quickly,
            <br>and are easily washed away even.

        <img src="Point-5.jpg"><br>
        <li> 5.Avoid the use of balloons & plastic bags<br>
            Water balloons are made of rubber and plastic, while Pichkaris are simply made using plastic alone.
            <br>Our country landfills are already burdened with such overflowing garbage. 
            <br>These things don't even decompose in a thousand years... Thus, celbrating HOLI in this way,
            <br> is only a source of tons of garbage.
    
        <img src="Point-6.jpg"><br>
        <li>6.Decorate your house with recycled or paper products<br>
            We shouldn't use plastic decorations during Holi and choose an environmentally friendly way to decorate our home. 
            <br>Most of the festive decorations nowadays are mostly made from plastic which can cause harm to the environment. 
            <br>This can easily be achieved bu using waster paper and newspaper, the way keeping our decorations
            <br>neat, beautiful and ina eco-friendly manner.
    
        <img src="Point-7.jpg"><br>
        <li>7. Eco-friendly Holi bonfire<br>
            The burning of fuelwood to create the bonfire presents another serious environmental problem. 
            <br>Considering that approximately 30,000 bonfires are lit in the state of Gujarat alone just for one season, 
            <br>this leads to wastage of a staggering amount of wood.Instead of using precious wood by chopping off the trees, 
            <br>one can burn eco-friendly waste for the Holi bonfire which will not create any air pollution. 
            <br>Use ingredients like cow-dung cakes, coconut waste, and camphor to light up.
            
        <img src="Point-8.jpg"><br>
        <li>8.Prepare homemade sweets and avoid outside food<br>
            To avoid any kind of contamination during this coronavirus outbreak, 
            <br>prepare all of your food and sweets at home. 
            <br>Instead of eating outside and buying sweets from shops, you can prepare delicious sweets and dishes 
            <br>by following cooking videos and apps.
            
        <img src="Point-9.jpg"><br>
        <li>9.Avoid eating in styrofoam cups and bowls<br>
            We see a lot of styrofoam plates, plastic cutlery and plastic cups lying around. 
            <br>Even during the celebration of Holi, the scene is not much different. 
            <br>Free foods are served in every corner and people from all sections are welcome to eat, 
            <br>but with this rises the problem of non-biodegradable trash. So we should use eco-friendly disposables
            <br> as they easily decompose without harming the environment...
